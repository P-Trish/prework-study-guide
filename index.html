          <li> HTML stands for Hypertext Markup Language.</li>
          <li>The head element contains metadata, information about the webpage. </li>
          <li>The body element represents the visible content shown to the user.</li>
          <li>The child elements are elements that are nested inside other elements.</li>

        <h2>CSS</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>A margin indicates how much space we want around the oustdie of an element.</li>
          <li>A padding indicates how much space we want around the content inside an element.</li>
          <li>A box shadow adds shadow effects around an element's frame.</li>
          <li>Assigning colors in CSS can be done by semantic references such as "Gray" or "Blue" or referring to a color by its hexadecimal code or hex #.</li>
          <li>Do Not Repeat Yourself (DRY) is a coding principle that encourages developers to reuse or share pieces of code in order to reduce the number of lines of code that need to be written or maintained.</li>
          <li>The period preceding "card" designates this as a class selector.  Any HTML element assigned to the class, "card" will gain these property assignments from the CSS.</li>

        <h2>JavaScript</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Enter your JavaScript notes here</li>
          <li>A variable is a named container that allows us to store data in our code.</li>
          <li>Control flow is the order in which a computer executes code in a script.</li>
          <li>Best Practice: Always write a semicolon after a statement to reduce chances of bugs getting in the code</li>
          <li>JavaScript is case sensitive!</l1>
          <li>A string is surrounded by quotation marks</li>
          <li>Conditional statements and loops control the order code is executed or even executed at all.</l1>
          <li>An array is a single variable used to hold a group of related data</li>
          <li>Conditional statements interrupt control flow so that different code executes depending on a condition that evaluates as truthy ("if" or "else if")</li>
          <li>An "if" statement introduces decision-making in code so that code will only execute if the statement meets a condition or is true</li>
          <li>A "loop" uses predictable pattern of indices to perform a tas on all the items in an arrayby allowing a single code block to be executed over and over</li>
          <li>"For" loops contain three importatnt statements: 1. keyword 'for', 2. three-part conditional statement, 3. code block (console.log) statement</li>
          <li>A function is a set of instructions that tells the computer how to perform a certain task</li>
          <li>2 Requirements for a JavaScript function: 1. Define the function with a function declaration, 2. Call the function for it to execute</li>
          <li>Important Note: Always include parentheses whenever you write a function</li>
